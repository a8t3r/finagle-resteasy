Finagle is an open-source library from twitter that provides a lightweight
abstraction for HTTP services.

RestEASY is JBoss's implementation of the JAX-RS standard, which general makes
writing REST services a matter of slapping some annotations on your code.

This project bridges the two, allowing you to serve RestEASY-annotated code
through Finagle.
